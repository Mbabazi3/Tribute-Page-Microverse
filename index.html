          The son of a barber, Daniel Hale Williams founded the first
          black-owned hospital in America, and performed the world's first
          successful heart surgery, in 1893. Williams was born in 1858 in
          Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, the fifth of seven children.

          After his father died, his mother, Sara Price Williams, moved the
          family several times. Young Daniel started as a shoemaker, but quickly
          knew he wanted more education. He completed secondary school in
          Wisconsin. At age 20, Williams became an apprentice to a former
          surgeon general for Wisconsin. Williams studied medicine at Chicago
          Medical College.

          Determined that Chicago should have a hospital where both black and
          white doctors could study and where black nurses could receive
          training, Williams rallied for a hospital open to all races. After
          months of hard work, he opened Provident Hospital and Training School
          for Nurses on May 4, 1891, the country's first interracial hospital
          and nursing school.

          In 1894, Dr. Williams became chief surgeon of Freedmen's Hospital in
          Washington, D.C., the most prestigious medical post available to
          African Americans then. There, he made improvements that reduced the
          hospital's mortality rate. In 1895, he helped to organize the National
          Medical Association for black professionals, who were barred from the
          American Medical Association. Williams returned to Chicago, and
          continued as a surgeon. In 1913, he became the first African American
          to be inducted into the American College of Surgeons.

          As a sign of the esteem of the black medical community, until this
          day, a "code blue" at the Howard University Hospital emergency room is
          called a "Dr. Dan." In words that could later be said of Vivien
          Thomas, a colleague wrote, "His greatest pride was that directly or
          indirectly, he had a hand in the making of most of the outstanding
          Negro surgeons of the current generation."
